**Agent-Based Models**

1. Serengeti (Julia) - model of game theory strategies in a spatial environment with a focus on gene-centric strategy. Additional focus of the model is on the gene fitness.

2. Evolutionary Competition Framework (NetLogo and Julia) - model of individual and group strategies in a game theoretical environment.

3. Cooperation Evolution (Python) - model of how cooperation may emerge from repeated interactions between agents.

4. Rationality Model (NetLogo) - model of how certain cooperative strategies can survive and outcompete more selfish strategies. Notably, the related paper also provides guidance on consistent strategy choice across multiple game-theoretical environments.

**Statistical Analysis**

1. General Social Survey Polarization (Python) - an analysis of the General Social Survey data over 50 years to determine the presence and evolution of polarization in the political opinions of the population.

**Machine Learning**

1. Bible Sentiment Analysis (Python - Jupyter Notebook) - Natural Language Processing paper that aims to unearth shifts in the sentiment towards certain concepts (e.g. men and women).
